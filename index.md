## Our Model
The New England Software Carpentry Library Consortium (NESCLiC), an association of academic libraries, joined together to build a community of practice focused on building data science skills including research computing and extracting, wrangling, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. NESCliC member institutions share a Gold-level Software Carpentry (SWC) membership, which affords NESCLiC 6 free coordinated workshops, a 50% discount on the cost for additional coordinated workshops, no charge for self-organized workshops, and fifteen instructors trained, per year. 

NESCLiC provides the opportunity for members to:

* Develop instructional materials
* Build a network of data fluent researchers and instructors 
* Refine skills by participating as instructors at other member institutions

Financial commitment: Cost of shared Carpentry membership ($1000/person) plus training expenses (travel or hosting)

Time commitment: (2) – two-day training workshops plus committee work

NESCLiC has established bylaws and members contribute to the consortium by participating in one of several roles:
