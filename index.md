The **New England Software Carpentry Library Consortium** or **NESCLiC** is an association of academic libraries, joined as a community of practice focused on building data science skills in research computing, and extracting, wrangling, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. NESCLiC allows member institutions to share in a Gold-level membership with the Carpentries. 


## Our Model
NESCliC member institutions share a Gold-level Carpentries membership, which affords NESCLiC 6 free coordinated workshops, a 50% discount on the cost for additional coordinated workshops, no charge for self-organized workshops, and fifteen instructors trained, per year. 

NESCLiC provides the opportunity for members to:

* Develop instructional materials
* Build a network of data fluent researchers and instructors 
* Refine skills by participating as instructors at other member institutions

**Financial commitment**: Cost of shared Carpentry membership ($1000/person) plus training expenses (travel or hosting)

**Time commitment**: (2) â€“ two-day training workshops plus committee work

NESCLiC has established bylaws and members contribute to the consortium by participating in one of several roles:
* Carpentries liaison
* Membership/Recruiting
* Assessment
* Outreach
* Workshop coordination
